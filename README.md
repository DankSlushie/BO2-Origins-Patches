# BO2-Origins-Patches

I would recommend using Redacted BO2 for these mods: https://redacted.se/

This is a good tutorial for intalling it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clJOLuIpxR0

Patches go in the data/scripts folder of your Redacted

Decompiled scripts go in the data/maps/mp folder of your Redacted (don't rename them)

Textures go in the data/images folder of your Redacted (don't rename them)
