# BO2-Origins-Patches

I would recommend using Redacted BO2 for these mods: https://redacted.se/

This is a good tutorial for intalling it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clJOLuIpxR0

Patches go in the data/scripts folder of your Redacted

Decompiled scripts go in the data/maps/mp folder of your Redacted

If you have any questions, DM me on discord: Dank Slushie#9682
